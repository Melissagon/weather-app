<h2>5 Day Weather</h2>

This app allows a user to view the current weather information as well as the upcoming 5 day forecast for any city. This is accomplished by typing city name into the search bar and clicking the search button (or pressing Enter). The city weather information is then shown and the city is listed in the recent searches below the search button. Those resent searches can be clicked and the current city weather information is shown again for that city.
